# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Paul]

### Day 0 (18th October 2022): 
**Today's Progress**: 
I had the idea to create a simple blog where everyone can post their thoughts and share their expirience. Today I created the Database and the login and signUp pages (without style), i choose php as lagnuage for the website.

**Thoughts:**  I struggled with the msqli class, it wasn't installed on the machine that I was using to test the website; I think the Database, even if it's simple, needs a little polishing. Tomorrow I'm going to implement a remember me function and work on the signup side and maybe create a style that would beautify the website

### Day 1 (19th October 2022):
**Today's Progress**: 
Today I continued the website, I created the homepage where i implemented the remember me function, i also created the signup page and the style for the website. I also created a function that checks if the user is logged in or not and redirects him to the login page if he isn't.

**Thoughts:** Learning new stuff is fun, today I managed to finally learn how the flex container works, i thought it was a little bit complicated but it's actually pretty simple. I also learned the best practice to implement the remember me function. I'm going to continue working on the website tomorrow and maybe create a function that allows the user to change his password.
