# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Paul]

### Day 0 (18th October 2022): 
**Today's Progress**: 
I had the idea to a simple blog where everyone can post their thoughts and share their expirience. Today I created the Database and the login and signUp pages (without style)

**Thoughts:**  I struggled with the msqli class, it wasn't installed on the machine that I was using to test the website; I think the Database, even if it's simple, needs a little polishing. Tomorrow I'm going to implement a remember me function and work on the signup side and maybe create a style that would beautify the website
